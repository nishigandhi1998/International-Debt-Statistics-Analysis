# International-Debt-Statistics-Analysis

Just like citizens go to a bank if they need money to grow economically, countries also approach the World Bank for loans to support development in their countries. In this project, We will explore countries' debts(in USD) to the World Bank using SQL.

Dataset: The dataset belongs to the World Bank and contains information about how much money countries worldwide owe to the Bank.
Find Dataset: https://www.worldbank.org/en/home

SQL Project :
We are going to find the answers to questions like:

- What is the total amount of money that countries owe to the World Bank?
- Which country has the highest debt, and what does that amount look like?
- What is the mean debt owed by countries for different debt indicators? 

etc...

I got the project idea from the below link, If you want to explore more about SQL Project ideas in 2023:
